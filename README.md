# Odin Recipes

**[This](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)** is my first project from **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)**, [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) and **my first website**.

This project is about creating a **basic website** with **_recipes_**. I used just the basic HTML elements, like:

- text elements (headings, paragraphs, `em` and `strong`, etc.)
- `div`
- lists
- links
- images

---

### Update:

- I added a little bit of CSS:
  - color & text styling
  - working with basic selectors
  - working with the box model

---

I hope it will go well and I can revisit the website in the future to see the progress.
