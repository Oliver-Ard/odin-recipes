<h2>TOP First project!</h2>

<p>This is my first html project for TOP.</p>

<p>This project is about creating a <strong>basic website</strong> with recipes. I will practice here just the basic stuffs about html, like:
<ol>
    <li> basic text elements (headings, paragraphs, bold and italic text, etc.);</li>
    <li> working with lists;</li>
    <li> using links and images;</li>
</ol></p>

<p>I hope it will went well and I can revisit the website in the future to see the progress.</p>
