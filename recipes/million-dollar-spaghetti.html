    <div class="headings">Steps for the recipe:</div>

    <div class="steps">
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C.</li>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
          boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 to 12
          minutes. Drain,
        </li>
        <li>
          While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high
          heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly,
          5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer to a bowl and mix
          in spaghetti sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place 1/2 of the butter slices into the bottom of a 9x13-inch
          casserole dish. Spread 1/2 of the spaghetti into the dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl;
          spread mixture over spaghetti. Cover with remaining spaghetti and top
          with remaining slices of butter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour ground beef mixture over spaghetti and spread in an even layer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Spread Cheddar cheese on
          top and continue baking until cheese has melted and is lightly
          browned, about 15 minutes more.
        </li>
