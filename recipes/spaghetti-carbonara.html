    <p>
      Carbonara is made with guanciale (cured pork), eggs, Pecorino Romano
      cheese, spaghetti pasta, and lots of black pepper. Italians don't add
      extra ingredients like cream, milk, garlic, or onions. Try this recipe
      if you want to make an authentic, creamy carbonara that comes straight
      from Italy.

  <div class="headings">Steps for the recipe:</div>
  <div class="steps">
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale (see
        Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and
        crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the
        boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring
        occasionally, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper
        in a bowl until smooth and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and
        slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <div class="headings">Recipe Tips</div>
  <p>
    You can substitute unsmoked bacon or pancetta for guanciale, bucatini for
    spaghetti, and Parmesan cheese for Pecorino Romano if desired. Guanciale,
    dry-cured pork jowl, is available from specialty markets. Use Italian
    pasta for best results. Ask somebody to hold the pot so you can stir pasta
    quickly when pouring in egg mixture
