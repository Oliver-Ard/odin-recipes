      alla Romana recipe:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>4 skinless</strong>, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded to
        an even thickness;
      </li>

      <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <div class="headings">Steps for the recipe:</div>
    <div class="steps">
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place chicken breasts onto a sheet of parchment paper. Place a
          prosciutto slice and a sage leaf onto each breast. Roll chicken from
          the short end over prosciutto and secure with wooden skewers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add rolled chicken and
          cook until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add wine, salt, and
          pepper; cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 8 to 10
          minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
          read at least 74 degrees C. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <br />

    <div class="headings">Editor's Note:</div>
    <p>
      To make the magazine version of this recipe, while the chicken rests, let
      the pan juices simmer until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Garnish the
      chicken with herbs and serve with the pan juices. If desired, serve over
      lightly seasoned orzo.
